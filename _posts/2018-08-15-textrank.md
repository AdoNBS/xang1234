### Introduction
[TextRank](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf) is a graph based algorithm for Natural Language Processing that can be used for keyword and sentence extraction. The algorithm is inspired by [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) which was used by Google to rank websites. For a web page $$, $$In(V_i)$$ is the set of webpges pointing to it while $$$$ is the set of vertices $$V_i$$ points to. The rank of $$V_i$$ is defined as:   

$$S(V_i)= (1-d) + d * \sum_{j\in{In(V_i)}} \frac{S(V_j)}{|Out(V_j)|}$$

where d is a damping factor between 0 and 1.

In the case of text, the connections can be weighted so we introduce $w_i_j$ which is the weight of the edge between entity $$V_i$$and $$V_j$$. The weighed rank of $$V_i$$ now becomes:

$$WS(V_i)= (1-d) + d * \sum_{V_j\in{In(V_i)}} \frac{w_j_i}{\sum_{V_k\in{Out(V_j)}}w_j_k}WS(V_j)$$

We have the choice of using words, collocations, or even sentences as vertices of our graph. The same goes for the connection between the vertices.
