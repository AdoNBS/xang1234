### Introduction
[TextRank](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf) is a graph based algorithm for Natural Language Processing that can be used for keyword and sentence extraction. The algorithm is inspired by [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) which was used by Google to rank websites.

$$S(V_i)= (1-d) + d * \sum_{j\in{In(V_i)}} \frac{S(V_j)}{\Vert{Out(V_j)}}$$
