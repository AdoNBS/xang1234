### Introduction
[Ternary Plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_plot) enable us to visualize 3 parameters simultaneously on a plane. The proportion of the 3 variables must sum up to a constant.

### Data
In a previous [post](({{site.url }}{{site.baseurl }}/_pages/2018-08-06-bubbleplot.md) we created bubble plots based on the proportion of young and economically active in Singapore's subzones. However we were unable to plot the proportion of the old in the same graph. This set of data is ideal for a ternary plot.
