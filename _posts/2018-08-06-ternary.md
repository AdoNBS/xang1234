### Introduction
[Ternary Plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_plot) enable us to visualize 3 parameters simultaneously on a plane. The proportion of the 3 variables must sum up to a constant.

### Data
In a previous [post]({{site.url }}{{site.baseurl }}/bubbleplot) we created bubble plots based on the proportion of young and economically active in Singapore's subzones. However we were unable to plot the proportion of the old in the same graph. This set of data is ideal for a ternary plot.

We will use the Singapore population [data]({{site.url }}{{site.baseurl }}/data/Singapore_Population_Calc.csv) available from [Singstat](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/population/geographic-distribution/latest-data). Population data in the various residential [subzones, planning areas and planning regions](https://data.gov.sg/dataset?q=Subzone+Boundary) are available from 2002 to 2017. Singstat breaks down the population by 5 year cohorts; 0-4 years old, 5-9 years old, and so forth. For our analysis we will group the population into young (0-24 years old), economically active (25-64 years old) and old (65 years and above). Here is the header of our table
