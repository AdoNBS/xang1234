excerpt: "Choropleths allow the display of statistical variables on shaded regions of maps. For example the GDP of countries or states can be displayed with different color levels. We usually display data according to the geographical administrative subdivision; country, region, state, county, etc. as these are common definitions shared by everyone and statistics are usually available. A judicious choice of color palette will allow us to present the data coherently. For example, GDP data where growth can be positive or negative - a contrasting scale like Red-Yellow-Green will allow better representation compared to a blue only scale. "

### Introduction
[Choropleths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map) allow the display of statistical variables on shaded regions of maps. For example the GDP of countries or states can be displayed with different color levels. We usually display data according to the geographical administrative subdivision; country, region, state, county, etc. as these are common definitions shared by everyone and statistics are usually available. A judicious choice of color palette will allow us to present the data coherently. For example, GDP data where growth can be positive or negative - a contrasting scale like Red-Yellow-Green will allow better representation compared to a blue only scale.
