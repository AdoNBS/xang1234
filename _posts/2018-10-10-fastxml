### 1. Introduction

Previously we [explored]({{site.url }}{{site.baseurl }}/multi-label) multi-label algorithms using the [Scikit-multilearn](http://scikit.ml/)

### 2. Datasets

Datasets are

### 3. Metrics - Normalized Discounted Cummulative Gain (nDCG)

The notion of what constitutes a good prediction changes when we go for a few labels to millions of labels.

Define rank

### 4. FastXML

An efficient methode that is able to scale to millions of labels is the FastXML algorithm by Yashoteja Prabhu and Manik Varma as described in their
[paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/fastxml-a-fast-accurate-and-stable-tree-classifier-for-extreme-multi-label-learning/).

It is a tree type classifier algorithm that splits the feature space instead of the label space.

Refefer implemented the FastXML algorithm in python/cython as share in [this github repository](https://github.com/Refefer/fastxml/tree/master/fastxml)
### 5. Performance on Datasets
