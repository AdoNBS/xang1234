### Introduction
Machine learning algorithms are only as good as the data available. Bringing in additional data can give us better insights and improve performance when we have maxed out the performance of the machine learning algorithms. One way to obtain additional data is to scrape websites. Unlike web crawling where search engine bots explore websites and their links, web scraping is specific and seeks to gather large quantities of information from certain websites, for example user comments on special interest forums, product listings, etc.

## Check if API available
Before building a scraper, always check if the information can be accessed via APIs. Registration is typically required but using an API would require less effort. Google is your best friend. Certain [websites](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) also list out available APIs.
